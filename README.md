# TransTEx (Transcript-level Tissue Expression)

**TransTEx** is a comprehensive R package developed by the Davuluri Lab for analyzing and exploring tissue-specific transcript/gene expression patterns. This tool introduces a novel tissue-specificity scoring method to group the human transcriptome into distinct expression categories. TransTEx enables the discovery of tissue-specific and tissue-enhanced transcripts across conditions using bulk-transcriptomic data.
